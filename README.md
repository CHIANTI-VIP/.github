CHIANTI-VIP (CHIANTI Virtual IDL and Python), developed and mantained by Giulio Del Zanna, 
is a member of the CHIANTI family, where we provide atomic data and codes to the astrophysics community. 

The importance of our work has been recognised in 2024 by a NASA group achievement award to the CHIANTI team.

The CHIANTI family comprises of 

1) the CHIANTI standard database and IDL programs, distributed via SolarSoft,
 a programming and data analysis environment for the solar physics community: http://www.lmsal.com/solarsoft/ 
 and via the webpages at http://www.chiantidatabase.org/

The database has been developed and mantained by the CHIANTI team.
The current IDL programs have been developed and mantained by  Peter Young and Giulio Del Zanna
The web pages and the user guide have been developed by Giulio Del Zanna

2) CHIANTIPy, a set of Python tools developed and mantained by Ken Dere, see https://github.com/chianti-atomic/ChiantiPy

3) FIASCO, a set of Python tools developed and mantained by Will Barnes, see https://github.com/wtbarnes/fiasco

CHIANTI-VIP is an open platform to  develop additional features and provide them to the community. 
They include additional IDL programs, and a set of python GUIs and virtual CHIANTI interfaces under development. The original 
python programs were developed in 2016 with a 3-months funding to Giulio Del Zanna from STFC (UK) via the UK-VAMDC proposal, 
a follow-up of the FP7 EU-funded grant VAMDC, 2008â€“2012, see 

https://vamdc.org/ 

Giulio Del Zanna, as a VAMDC consortium member contributed by making the CHIANTI data available. 

Additional features to the atomic data will be made available here, although the basic features will be the same as in 1.

Contributions from the community are welcomed.
